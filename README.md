# Spotify Data

## What?
A small website made with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [TS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) that gives you info on your Spotify account.     
(I'll add a preview image here)

## How?
The website will ask for a client ID. See Spotify's [Documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started) to create your app.     
The redirect URI is set to `http://localhost:5173/callback` and you may have to change it. Be sure to include this URI in your app's redirects.
